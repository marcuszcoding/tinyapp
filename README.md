## How to use TinyApp

1.) Boot Up And Register An Account

  - In order to use TinyApps features, you first head over to your browser of choice and port into your local host! For this app we will be using localhost:8080
  
  - After porting into your localhost:8080 you will automatically be sent to the login page! Of course, if you've already used Tiny App you can just login but because this is more than likely your first time, look to the top right of Tiny App and click on "Register".

  - Now that you are at Register page, you can enter whichever email and password you want to use! After clicking registering your account will be made and logged in!

2.) Creating Your First TinyURL

  - We should now be logged in so we can start using Tiny App! In order to create a new TinyURL for ourselves we will new to head to the "Create New URL" in the header. 

  - After heading to the Create New URL you can now shorten whichever longURL you want! Make sure to include the "http://"!

3.) Managing And Using Your New Tiny URLs!

  - You should now see our newly created TinyURL! Lets try out our new TinyURL! To use our new tiny URl we put localhost:8080/u/(TinyURL). Tiny URL in this case being the one you made!

  - To manage your Urls just click on the "My URLs" in the Header and you will be taken back to the main page with your new TinyURLs! You can either edit or delete them as you wish!
